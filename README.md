# GCI---data-visualization

This is repo for the GCI task "Interactive data visualization exercises using animint2". In this task, I am trying to complete the exercise in the animint manual Chapter 5, that is, "Use animint2gist to publish a visualization of a data set from your domain of expertise. " 

Althought the hospitality industry is not my expertise, but I am pretty interested in this subject. In this task, I tried to explore the relation between the price of an airbnb and its rating. 

I am also curious whether the size of the airbnb has any impact on that relation (one may think that people who book a larger house may be less sensitive to price, therefore the price-rating relationship of a larger house maybe less wrong than the price-rating of a smaller house). The size of the airbnb is captured by the rooms it has.

The interactive visualization of the data is published online, and can be viewed on http://bl.ocks.org/jiangworms/raw/693f8ae9ba3ed6949537476d4a1a58a4/
